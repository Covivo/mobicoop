###  No issue tracker ? No chat ? No email list ??
All people having a significant experience of open source projects know that opening a project to contributions is an investment. Our clients and shareholders wish that to keep our energy mostly focused on developing new features and services, and not yet on investing massively in building in the long term a strong developer community around the project.

But if the contributions continue to grow, we'll surely have to update this policy and progressively tool and improve this growing contributor's community!


Thanks thus for your contribution, because they matter a lot for us! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
