### Hooks

There is some git hooks implemented in this app:

### How to create my own front application

Because Mobicoop is a monorepo, you can ask yourself you to create & dev on you own front-end application.
Monicoop comes with a simple script to run, it will create a canvas skeletton based on mobicoop front-end & link the main bundle to it.

`mkdir -p ../path/to/newFront`

`npm run create-front-canvas ../path/to/newFront`

☢️ *Do not forget to commit into monorepo  ( & create branch if needed) when you edit bundle files* ☣️
